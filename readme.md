This is a very simple Windows application that allows you to change the mode of a DreamScreen TV.

For example, you could use this to automatically power down or switch your DreamScreen to Off, Video, Music, or Ambient.

Usage:
DreamScreenControl.exe <ip address> <mode>

Modes are:
0 - Off
1 - Video
2 - Music
3 - Ambient

Example:
DreamScreenControl.exe 192.168.1.123 1

You must input the IP address of your DreamScreen, which you can find by looking at the DHCP page of your router.
